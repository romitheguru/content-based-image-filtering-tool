# CONTENT BASED IMAGE FILTERING TOOL
Given a collection of images the goal is to filter out all the images that contain a specific object in them. For example, letâ€™s say we have our personal photo gallery and we want to see all the photos in which a car is present in the image. In this tool we will provide to the user several filter criteria like furniture, building, park, car, bike, trees, hills or tower etc. The user will be able to choose a filter and based on that can get all the images from a given collection
